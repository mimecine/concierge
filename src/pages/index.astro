                Welcome to V: Concierge, a virtual shopping experience. We are here to help you with your shopping needs, answer questions, and show you the
                latest products. This is a test of a new way to shop. We are using a video conferencing tool called Jitsi to create a virtual shopping
                experience. You can see us and we can see you. We can talk to each other and show you products. You can ask us questions and we can help you
                find what you are looking for.

                Needless to say, this is a work in progress, a beta experience. Stuff will break. Be sure to turn on your camera so we can see you and you can
                see us. Why is a good question. The answer is simple, we miss the shop and talking to all of you.

                If no-one is around, try messaging Marco on +1 917 945 2978 and ask us to pop in. We'll be right there. Unless we can't. Once this is up and
                running we plan to have regular hours, just like the New York store.
